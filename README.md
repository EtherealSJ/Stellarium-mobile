# Stellarium-android
## A version of Stellarium for android
## Please refer to README for original software

## Prerequisites
Qt-for-android (preferably qt 5.6 or higher)

Since qt does not provide a redistributable version of qt-for-android, you
may have to build it for yourself. The building procedure is already 
detaily documented in the document of qt. Please refer to qt.io for info.

## Installation
The original INSTALL file nearly states nothing, but some useful links are 
still provided within that document. Simply download and build. I have 
included all assets in this respository as I might modify them in the 
future.
